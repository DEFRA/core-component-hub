Core Component Hub – MVP PRD
Overview

The Core Component Hub is a directory of reusable components across Defra.
It helps teams find, understand and adopt existing components (e.g. Core Delivery Platform, Defra Forms, Defra Maps).

The Hub does not replace these products. It acts as a signpost to them, with clear ownership, documentation and guidance on when to use them.

Objectives

Provide a single trusted entry point for all Defra core components.

Reduce duplication by helping teams discover and reuse before building.

Improve consistency and compliance with Defra and GDS standards.

Make it clear that components are supported, maintained and safe to adopt.

Scope (MVP)
In scope

A web-based hub (internal) built using GOV.UK Design System.

Component catalogue page with:

List of approved components (Core Delivery Platform, Defra Forms, Defra Maps + 2–3 others).

Each item shows:

Name

Short description

Category (e.g. frontend, data, API, maps, forms)

Owner/contact

Link to documentation / repo

Status badge (Active, Beta, Deprecated)

Search and filter by category or status.

Landing page that explains the purpose:

What the Hub is

What it isn’t

How to use it

Contribution guide: simple guidance on how teams can propose adding their component.

Out of scope (MVP)

Hosting components directly.

Automated health checks (uptime, versioning).

Integration with CI/CD pipelines.

Usage analytics.

External/public access.

Users & Needs
Primary users

Delivery teams (developers, product managers, designers, BAs):

Need to quickly find existing, approved components.

Need confidence the component is maintained and trusted.

Secondary users

Component owners:

Need visibility so their component is reused.

Need to provide documentation in a consistent format.

User journeys (MVP)

Developer searching for mapping solution

Goes to Hub → sees Defra Maps → clicks through to docs → adopts instead of building new.

Product manager checking forms options

Goes to Hub → filters by “Forms” → sees Defra Forms → checks status → uses it.

Team lead with a reusable API

Reads contribution guidance → submits component for consideration.

Success criteria (MVP)

All major existing components (CDP, Forms, Maps) are clearly listed.

Teams report using the Hub to discover components.

Stakeholders confirm the Hub makes it clear what’s in/out of scope.

At least 2 new teams adopt an existing component through the Hub in the first quarter.

Non-functional requirements

Uses GOV.UK Design System for consistent look and feel.

Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).

Works on modern browsers and mobile devices.

Lightweight and fast (pages <1s load).

Governance

Owner: Defra Core Components team.

Content updates: owners must provide:

Description, documentation link, contact.

Status updates (every 6 months).

Review cycle: quarterly check to keep content accurate.

Risks & mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Teams see Hub as “another product”	Clear messaging: it’s a directory/signpost, not a platform
Outdated info reduces trust	Regular review cycle, clear ownership for each component
Teams ignore Hub	Promote at stand-ups, in onboarding, and Defra developer comms
